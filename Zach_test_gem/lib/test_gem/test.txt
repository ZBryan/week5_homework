The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species Malus domestica in the rose family (Rosaceae).
It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of genus Malus that
are used by humans. Apples grow on small, deciduous trees. The tree originated in Western Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were
brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have been present in the mythology and religions of many
cultures, including Norse, Greek and Christian traditions. In 2010, the fruit's genome was decoded, leading to new
understandings of disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
